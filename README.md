# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kiran

> Pronouns: he/him/his


My research focuses on using interaction provenance to enhance the reproducibility and reusability of interactive visual analysis.
I have a **strong software engineering** background, with experience developing and maintaining [**open-source** systems](https://github.com/trrack/trrackjs) [and libraries](https://github.com/Trrack/trrackvis).
I have experience building interactive visualization and analysis tools, and I like to think about how to improve the analyst's experience using these tools. You can view some videos showcasing my work [here](https://youtu.be/DXHXPvRHN9I?si=QIGTR-8rF0gvbGuC), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zUdTOarBIo), and [here](https://youtu.be/jDf4ndtekpk?si=-6OUgt2au_HNeZHT).

I completed my PhD from [Kahlert School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/) and the [Scientific Computing and Imaging Institue](https://sci.utah.edu/) at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/). I was supervised by [Dr. Alexander Lex](https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/team/lex/) at [Visualization Design Lab](https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/).
