# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kiran

I am a PhD student at University of Utah. I work with Dr. Alexander Lex.

My research area is data visualization and my research focus is literate and reusable visual analysis. I develop techniques to leverage interaction provenance to achieve reusable visual analysis.

I developed an open source library called [Trrack](https://github.com/Trrack/trrackjs) as part of my research, which I currently maintain.
